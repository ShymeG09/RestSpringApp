## About project
I just wanted to share my ability to write and understand the basics of Springboot using CRUD model and REST architecture.
I've created this to prove my skills.
## Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Spring
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
## Setup
I was inspired by Java Teacher to try it myself. Just like him I chose the PostgreSQL as my object-relational database.
I've created table named 'products' in pgAdmin4. The 'orders' are not finished yet, but You can look at my code and try to make Your own DB :)

I switched my app to port 8081 so keep that in mind while You trying to connect with it.
